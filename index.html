  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

  <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>We are happy to accommodate your study with us at any time; however it would suit us <strong>better</strong> if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates for each one are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
    <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
    <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you’d prefer.</p>
  <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com" title="Important university dates">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have an open-minded research facility—as long as subjects fall within science and technology. You seem like an <em>intelligent, dedicated</em> researcher, the kind of person we’d like on our team. Of your submitted ideas, the most intriguing are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
    <li>Measuring performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F), when audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
    <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post‑doctorate work, I <strong>did</strong> study exotic tribal dances. Here’s a summary of my favourites, with definitions:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300 <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, when a whole village danced around in a circle like chickens to encourage their livestock to be “fruitful”.</dd>

    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before Icelanders developed fire, they practiced this dance—huddling in a circle and shuffling tiny, rapid movements. One student thought it inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>

    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation: English explorers in the 1960s thought they’d discovered a robotic-style dance practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska—but they were simply freezing.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Yours sincerely,<br><strong>Dr. Eleanor Gaye</strong></p>
